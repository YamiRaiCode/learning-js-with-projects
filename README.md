# LEARNING JAVASCRIPT WITH PROJECTS (MY PROCESS)

I'm learning JavaScript right now because I want to work my way up to being a Front-End developer. And in order to track my development and become used to GitHub, I wanted to share it here. Maybe I can inspire people who, like me, are just starting out, to NEVER GIVE UP.

### What will happen next?

There are currently no projects in the repository because I'm in the learning phase. I will share what I learn day by day on this page. And as I complete each project, I will add to the repository. WISH ME LUCK :shipit:

## DAY 1

I couldn't go very far because I started a little late, but I did understand JavaScript's basic logic.

* [x] Variable Definition.
* [x] DOM basics.
* [x] Access HTML elements in JavaScript.


See you tomorrow!! I'm so excited to do this.
