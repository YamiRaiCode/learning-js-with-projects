# LEARNING JAVASCRIPT WITH PROJECTS (MY PROCESS)

I'm learning JavaScript right now because I want to work my way up to being a Front-End developer. And in order to track my development and become used to GitHub, I wanted to share it here. Maybe I can inspire people who, like me, are just starting out, to NEVER GIVE UP.

"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."

### What will happen next?

There are currently no projects in the repository because I'm in the learning phase. I will share what I learn day by day on this page. And as I complete each project, I will add to the repository. WISH ME LUCK :shipit:

# FIRST PROJECT - BUILDING A ROLE PLAYING GAME

## DAY 1

I couldn't go very far because I started a little late, but I did understand JavaScript's basic logic.

#### What I learn Today?
* [x] Variable Definition.
* [x] DOM basics.
* [x] Access HTML elements in JavaScript.


See you tomorrow!! I'm so excited to do this.

## DAY 2

I've enhanced the interactivity of the game buttons, granting players seamless access to various locations such as the store and cave.

#### What I learn TODAY?
* [x] How to create objects.
* [x] Diffirences between objects and arrays.
* [x] Function declarations
* [x] Calling Functions.
* [x] How to push items into arrays. (push())
* [x] How to change text of an HTML element with JS.  

I aspire to press on, but weariness has begun to set in. :zzz:

## DAY 3

I'm thrilled to share that after three days of dedicated effort, I've successfully completed my first game! While it posed a bit of a challenge as my initial project, my programming background provided a solid foundation that eased the process. The game is now available in my repository, and I'd love for you to check it out. Your feedback would mean a lot to me!

I learned different things today so I don't know how to name it but in short:

* [x] How to generate random numbers.
* [x] How to update CSS properties in JS
* [x] The shift() method to removes the first element in the array and returns it.
* [x] How to make things with a random chance using random numbers.
* [x] And more of them... (I can't classify some of them)

And for those interested, I am studying with freeCodeCamp 🔥
  
  •I've never used freeCodeCamp before. And I would advise those who are new to programming not to start here before developing programming logic.

## DAY 4

I haven't been doing much today because of my exams, which start in about a week. I need to focus on studying for my lessons. However, I did some practice on what I learned in my last project. I think that's enough for today.

* [x] Practice, Practice and More Practice... ✔️

## DAY 5 

I'm incredibly proud of myself! At first, diving into a new programming language was intimidating, but today, I've crafted my very own pixel art website. (Sure, it's not 100% finished, but no biggie!) I've written my own functions, called the shots on what needed to happen to bring this website to life, and more. The thrill of discovering my capabilities was absolutely exhilarating! I'm over the moon with happiness about it.

* [x] Practice, Practice and More Practice... ✔️
* [x] Learning BootStrap (in progress 🍓)
* [x] How to create HTML elements with JS
* [x] Studying exams (help me •-•)

When I finish it, I'll upload it to GitHub in a new repository.

## DAY 6 

It's actually a little difficult to identify it as "day 6" with precision. I had to take a break for about 2-3 weeks due to illness right after the exams. Considering that downtime during the exam week, it feels like ages since I last contributed to GitHub. But today, I've made significant progress on the pixel art site project I had been working on before falling ill. Certainly, I'm still improving my skills in JavaScript, so I'm pretty sure there might be quite a few optimization mistakes and such things in my code. I wanted to create a new repository for this project. So, here is it.

During the time when I wasn't active on GitHub, I had the opportunity to learn quite a bit. I delved deeper into various JavaScript concepts, explored new coding techniques and even I made a few basic projects. 

Below are the things I learned:

* [x] High Order Functions
* [x] Callback Functions ❔
* [x] Objects, Their Methods 
* [x] A Deeper Understanding of Javascript Objects
* [x] Constructor Functions
* [x] Using Event Listeners More And More 

I figured out that getting JavaScript right often boils down to using event listeners correctly. I struggled with a problem for a long time, only to realize it was due to me not handling event listeners properly. It taught me the importance of mastering this aspect of JavaScript for smoother coding.

## DAY XX 

Hello again, I have been working on many projects since my last commit to this repository. However, I have preferred to create a new repository for each new project, so I was not able to update this repository every time. Nevertheless, I have not abandoned it completely. I will come back from time to time to give you a brief summary of my situation. 🖤

## DAY XX7

Hi everyone!
I'm excited to announce that I've finished building a form-based calorie counter application! This project was a great way to delve into form validation and gain a deeper understanding of forms, inputs, and related functionalities.

Here are some key takeaways from working on this project:

* [x] Different types of form validation (e.g., required fields, data type checks)
* [x] Techniques for handling user input errors
* [x] Best practices for designing user-friendly forms
* [x] NodeLists
* [x] Regular expressions (Regex) ❗
* [x] Deep understanding of creating forms.
* [x] New methods (e.g. -> .insertAdjacentHTML() - .preventDefault() etc.)
* [x] for...of loops
* [x] And many other things

I'm happy to share more details about the project or the specific things I learned.
