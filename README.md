# LEARNING JAVASCRIPT WITH PROJECTS (MY PROCESS)

I'm learning JavaScript right now because I want to work my way up to being a Front-End developer. And in order to track my development and become used to GitHub, I wanted to share it here. Maybe I can inspire people who, like me, are just starting out, to NEVER GIVE UP.

### What will happen next?

There are currently no projects in the repository because I'm in the learning phase. I will share what I learn day by day on this page. And as I complete each project, I will add to the repository. WISH ME LUCK :shipit:
