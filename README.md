# LEARNING JAVASCRIPT WITH PROJECTS (MY PROCESS)

I'm learning JavaScript right now because I want to work my way up to being a Front-End developer. And in order to track my development and become used to GitHub, I wanted to share it here. Maybe I can inspire people who, like me, are just starting out, to NEVER GIVE UP.

"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."

### What will happen next?

There are currently no projects in the repository because I'm in the learning phase. I will share what I learn day by day on this page. And as I complete each project, I will add to the repository. WISH ME LUCK :shipit:

# FIRST PROJECT - BUILDING A ROLE PLAYING GAME

## DAY 1

I couldn't go very far because I started a little late, but I did understand JavaScript's basic logic.

#### What I learn Today?
* [x] Variable Definition.
* [x] DOM basics.
* [x] Access HTML elements in JavaScript.


See you tomorrow!! I'm so excited to do this.

## DAY 2

I've enhanced the interactivity of the game buttons, granting players seamless access to various locations such as the store and cave.

#### What I learn TODAY?
* [x] How to create objects.
* [x] Diffirences between objects and arrays.
* [x] Function declarations
* [x] Calling Functions.
* [x] How to push items into arrays. (push())
* [x] How to change text of an HTML element with JS.  

I aspire to press on, but weariness has begun to set in. :zzz:

## DAY 3

I'm thrilled to share that after three days of dedicated effort, I've successfully completed my first game! While it posed a bit of a challenge as my initial project, my programming background provided a solid foundation that eased the process. The game is now available in my repository, and I'd love for you to check it out. Your feedback would mean a lot to me!

I learned different things today so I don't know how to name it but in short:

* [x] How to generate random numbers.
* [x] How to update CSS properties in JS
* [x] The shift() method to removes the first element in the array and returns it.
* [x] How to make things with a random chance using random numbers.
* [x] And more of them... (I can't classify some of them)

And for those interested, I am studying with freeCodeCamp üî•
  
  ‚Ä¢I've never used freeCodeCamp before. And I would advise those who are new to programming not to start here before developing programming logic.

## DAY 4

I haven't been doing much today because of my exams, which start in about a week. I need to focus on studying for my lessons. However, I did some practice on what I learned in my last project. I think that's enough for today.

* [x] Practice, Practice and More Practice... ‚úîÔ∏è

## DAY 5 

I'm incredibly proud of myself! At first, diving into a new programming language was intimidating, but today, I've crafted my very own pixel art website. (Sure, it's not 100% finished, but no biggie!) I've written my own functions, called the shots on what needed to happen to bring this website to life, and more. The thrill of discovering my capabilities was absolutely exhilarating! I'm over the moon with happiness about it.

* [x] Practice, Practice and More Practice... ‚úîÔ∏è
* [x] Learning BootStrap (in progress üçì) 
* [x] Studying exams (help me ‚Ä¢-‚Ä¢)

When I finish it, I'll upload it to GitHub in a new repository.
